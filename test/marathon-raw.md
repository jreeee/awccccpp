Have you always wanted to watch a long anime but it was too much for any other challenge? This is the time to clear those long shows from your plan to watch list or to find new ones. \nThe challenge is to watch any __10 anime__ totaling a number of __422 Episodes__ (the length of a marathon is 42.2 km). Don't try any tricks though, no short episodes allowed. \nWill you be able to make it the whole length of the Marathon? How long will it take you to finish? You can only find out if you take part. \n\n\n---\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/1bFlDTh.png)~~~ \n\n<center>img40%(https://i.postimg.cc/zvscnnwW/Special-Marathon.png)</center>\n~~~**Riku Yagami from [Prince Of Stride: Alternative](https://anilist.co/anime/21330/)**\nBadge designed by [skirider7](https://anilist.co/user/skirider7/)~~~\n~~~**Rewards:** 3 [Challenge Points](https://anilist.co/activity/93614073) & Badge \n\n~~~\n\n---\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/rCCm0RN.png)~~~\n\n<h2>__Minimum Total Episodes: 422__</h2><ul><li>You __must__ complete 10 anime total</li><li>__15 minutes Episode Duration__ minimum</li><li>You __can__ rewatch anime for this challenge</li><ul><li>You __must__ state if you rewatched an anime in your challenge post</li><li>Rewatches __must__ be [correctly logged on AniList](https://i.imgur.com/WqrY9qV.png) to count</li><ul><li>To log a rewatch, set an anime to rewatching and increment the episodes via the Anime In Progress panel on the AniList home page</li><li>An activity showing the episodes as rewatched will appear in your feed.
